# Launching the application
The application is contained in a single JAR file, which can be found in the Deliveries section of the repository

## Server
The machine running the server must be reachable from the clients in order to play the game. To start the server, use the command

java -jar GC36.jar -server

The server, when launched, will ask the user which port he wants to open the connection from.
Once launched, the server will print the events log on the standard output.

## Client
To launch the clients there are a few options:
For a basic setup (Graphical interface), just use the command

java -jar GC36.jar -client

from there, you can add a few extra flags:

-cli lets you launch the application via a command line interface

-cli -color lets you launch the command line interface with added depth, but make sure your Shell fully supports ANSI color codes, otherwise you will encounter a few problems during the game

-cli -gui lets you launch the application via a graphic interface (which is strongly recommended to enjoy the game)

## Test Coverage
The application has been thoroughly tested via automated tests (Junit) in controller and model classes, further testing has been done manually for all the other classes. 
Here is the test coverage (generated by IntelliJ)

## Further information on the gameplay

For every other doubt, just click on the help button.
